    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This two-ingredient peanut butter fudge recipe is the easiest fudge ever, and it is so good. Every time I make it, I get so many compliments on how great it is. I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound white confectioners' coating (white almond bark), broken up</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter (such as Jif)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with plastic wrap long enough to overhang the dish by several inches on each side.</li>
        <li>Place almond bark in a large glass microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on low power until melted, smooth, and creamy, about 5 minutes, stirring every 30 to 60 seconds. 
            Stir in peanut butter until fudge is thoroughly combined. Spread into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until set, 1 to 2 hours. Lift fudge out of the pan using the overhanging plastic wrap as handles; slice into 48 squares with a pizza cutter.</li>
    </ol>
