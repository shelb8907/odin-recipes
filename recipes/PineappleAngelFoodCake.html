    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This 2-ingredient pineapple angel food cake recipe is easy and delicious. Store leftovers, covered, in the refrigerator.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, in juice</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel food cake mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat crushed pineapple with juice and cake mix in a large bowl with an electric mixer
            on low speed for 30 seconds, then beat on medium speed for 1 minute. 
            Pour into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until deep golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. 
            Cool in the pan, inverted onto a wire rack, or thin-necked glass bottle (such as a wine bottle); 
            this will prevent the cake from sinking, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Run a table knife around the edges of the tube pan; turn out onto a serving plate. 
            Cut into slices using a serrated knife.</li>
    </ol>
